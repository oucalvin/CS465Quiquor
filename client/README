Following the advice seen at      :
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16176701/switch-between-panes-in-javafx         AND
    https://blogs.oracle.com/acaicedo/entry/managing_multiple_screens_in_javafx1
I have decided that we will have one fxml containing a stackpane that will hold each view
We will create a ScreenController Class that will manage the StackPane so that we can have
    animations, high performance, and only one active Controller.
